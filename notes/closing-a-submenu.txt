Close a submenu:

. Create a ClearSprite
. use freemask,
. Sprite's mask is size of entire canvas so that all taps are captured
. create a second mask/Shape that exactly overlays the submenu (menumask)

    on: {
        'collide#screentap': function (tap) {
            // Close when tapped outside of the menu.
            if (!tap.intersects(menumask)) {
                $.screen('shop').stop();
                $.screen('training').start();
            }
        }
    }

. Use collide with screentap since all taps are captured
. use !tap.intersects(menumask) to check if tap was outside of menu
. close dat menu if tap was outside of submenu
